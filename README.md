A text based game where you fight rounds of monsters increasing in difficulty



The player fights through rounds of monsters of increasing difficulty.



The player and monster take turns to perform an action, which includes a light attack, heavy attack, and block. Each action costs a certain amount of energy for the player.

After each monster has been defeated, the player can choose a provided upgrade.

The game continues until the player is defeated.



The game rules and high scores can be viewed in the main menu. The player can also change their name in the menu.

When a player changes their name or exits the game, their number of rounds played and number of high scores achieved will be displayed.



The program files are in the MonsterHunter folder and the application file is in the Application folder.
