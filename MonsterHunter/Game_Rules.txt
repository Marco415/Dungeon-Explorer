**MONSTER HUNTER GAME RULES**

~About the game~
Monster Hunter is an arcade style game where the player fights through rounds of monsters.
The higher the game round, the more difficult the monsters will get.
With random monster levels, random monster attacks and round end upgrades, 
you must think carefully about your next move if you wish to reach the top of the leaderboard.

~Rules for player names~
A name cannot be completely empty and it must start with a letter.

~Play game~
When the player chooses to play a game, a monster is randomly generated.
Thereafter, both the player's and monster's stats will be displayed.
Next, the player can choose how to attack the monster.
For a heavy attack, 5 energy is required and for a light attack, 2 energy is required.
No energy is required to block an attack.
The player also cannot use an attack if they have insufficient energy.
If the monster is still alive, it then also has a chance to attack.
A monster has the same attack types as the player, but does not have an energy requirement.
If the player or monster is defeated, the round ends.
If the player is dead, the game immediately ends, else the player can choose whether or not to continue.
If the player chooses to continue, they are given the opportunity to choose an upgrade.
1 is a health regen. 2 is an attack increase. 3 is a health increase. 4 is an energy increase.
If the player ascended a level, they can choose another upgrade.
When the game ends, the game results will be displayed.
If a new high score was achieved, it will also be displayed.

~High scores~
The top ten highest scores will be displayed.

~Change name~
The player can choose to change their name.
The same rules for player names as mentioned above will apply.
If the name was changed, the previous player will exit the game and have their final results displayed.
The new player will then play the game.
If the name was not changed, the same player will continue to play the game.

~Exit~
The player's final results will be displayed and the game will exit.
